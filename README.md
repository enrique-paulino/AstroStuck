# AstroStuck

## Introduction
You can download and play the game here: https://enrique-paulino.itch.io/astrostuck  
In this short game you play as an astronaut trying to make it back to their ship after being abandoned.  
Solve a few puzzles in order to get back. 

## Context
This game was created in 3 days as part of a weekend challenge I set up for myself. The idea was to create a simple game with 5 puzzles using only free assets. This game has a few bugs and can be fine tuned but I thought it was best to leave it in its final state which was at the point where the 3 days were over.

## Assets
All the code is written by me, excluding the occasional help needed from the unity forums. All the models and textures were free to use assets found online from either reddit or the unity asset store. All the sounds and music were from freesound.org
